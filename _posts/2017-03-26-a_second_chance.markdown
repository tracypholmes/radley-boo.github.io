My introduction to coding started when I was required to take an HTML course in business school. Truly, out of all the courses I had taken during my undergraduate studies, this baisc coding class was the most interestiing to me. I did, however, decide to stay on course with my undergraduate degrees in Marketing and Advertising. 

After having issues finding work once I graduated and then dealing with a serious illness for several years, I found myself with a chance to start over. I decide to persue a Master's degree in Web Design and Development through a well-regarded private university in my state. I enjoyed getting back into the saddle, but slowly things seemed to be off--like when it came to the 1.5 years of my education, the curriculum didn't include any kind of coding education. Once I graduated, I realized how short on knowledge and desired skills I was when I tried to apply for positions. It was embarrassing. Three years of education...worthless. 

Due to time spent pursuing my Master's degree, I really didn't have any option than to keep moving forward and hope the best in finding some type of career. Unfortunately, things never felt right while working with several different companies focusing on digital marketing. I wasn't passionate about marketing and always felt unsure about my future. 

Surprisingly, at a time of unemployment and uncertainty, I came across boot camps while doing some research possible career opporutnities. I had actually never heard of the coding bootcamp concept before and was immediately fascinated. I ended up staying up all night looking at different schools, their curriculum, alumni reviews. The idea of being able pursue my development career without having to go to school again for several years was exciting. It truly felt like I was getting a *second chance.* I knew fairly quickly Flatiron was the school I wanted learn from and took the jump by applying. 

I now find myself in the second week of studies and everything, including my perspective on life, is different. The stress from working in a job that I didn't fit with well was gone, I look forward to work on my coding studies, and just an overall exciting prospect in life. Before Flatiron, I really didn't know what I was going to do and it felt rather bleak. Now, everything has changed and I'm truly grateful.
