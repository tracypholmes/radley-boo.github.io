While I continue this new adventure into programming, one of the biggest lessons I have learned so far is that I should not and cannot go through this learning process alone. I have a tendancy to be "heads down" when I'm learning or coding, but at some point, this type of behavior could negatively impact my growth as a student of programming.

During a morning stand-up (a time for us to talk about goals, concerns,etc.) with our instructor, I mentioned an issue I had with a lab that entailed creating an actual tic tac toe board with Ruby. After our meeting, my instructor was able to look at my work and lead me in the right direction. In addition, some of what she spoke about helped me understand Ruby better. I will admit, that I was concerned about my work looking totally stupid to her, but I know it's just an insecurity I'm going to have to let go if I want to grow. 

The insight I gained from this was that it's great trying to figure a problem on your own, but that after an hour or two of searching, ask for help. I think stubbornly hung onto finding my answer for a couple of days, but that also slowed me from progressing on. Also, I learned more about Ruby from my instructor that will assist me with my future coding adventures!

Peace.
